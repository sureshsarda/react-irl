React - In Real Life.

We all have been in a place where we learned the theory or the topic but we are not sure how it will be used in real life. Any framework we learn or language we master - the theory is quite small compared to vast type of problems we encounter while working on a real world application.

React is a small framework compared to the variety of applications we can develop with it. There are 8-12 core topics, but the kind of applications we can develop with it are unlimited. In this repository, I plan to explore this vastness. I plan to create different type of applications and address the challenges faced while doing that.

Whether you are a fresh graduate out of college and learned React, but not sure what you should be knowing or you are a seasoned develper who have started to learn react and want to briefly know what are the best practices and tools at hand while using React - these pages would attempt to address all these questions.

Welcome. My name is Suresh, and this is React IRL.

You all know what are are components, how to pass data using props or get efficient while passing the data using `useContext`. We will use the basics of React and use them to build applications.
